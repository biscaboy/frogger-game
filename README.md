Implementation of the FEND Arcade Game

Frogger Arcade Game

This project completes all the requirements above.

I included the folling additional functionality:

1.  A simple scoreboard that increments when the player scores and decrements when there is a collision.

2.  Collectsbles.  The player can score extra points by picking up different types of Gems.  
	a.  Saphires (Blue) are 1 extra point    
	b.  Emeralds (Green) are 2 extra points.
	c.  Diamonds (Yellow) are 5 extra points.

3.  Animation to the player after scoring or a collision.

There is currently only a single level and the play never stops.
